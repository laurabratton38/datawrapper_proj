<p>A group of neighbors in the northeast Bronx were just fixing up damage from flooding during Hurricane Elsa when Ida hit. Now, residents are spending thousands more on repairs. </p>
<p> The neighbors, who live between 220th and 221st street on Barnes Avenue, said that the increase in flooding they’ve experienced this year has been exacerbated by backflow from their area’s sewer system.</p>
<p>They are not alone. Concerns about sewer systems have been seen across Community Board 12, which represents Olinville, Wakefield, Edenwald, Eastchester, and other neighborhoods in the northeast Bronx.</p>

<p> Between 2020 and 2021, 311 calls made to the DEP to complain about sewer systems increased to the highest in the last decade.
</p>
<p>Experts say the rise in complaints could be a result of pandemic impacts.
</p>
<p>“Because many people stayed home and spent more time at home, there has been
more pressure on the building systems,” said Mehdi Pourpeikari Heris, a professor of Urban Planning and Policy at Hunter College.
